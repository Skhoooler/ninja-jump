A small game on Flutter's Flame framework

# Overview

I wanted to try my hand at making a game. It was what originally got me interested in software development,
and I since I have been studying mobile app development with flutter recently, I wanted to give it a try.
I found the Flame game framework that worked with flutter, and this is the result. It is not as polished
as I would have liked, but I am proud of the result.

You play the game by clicking on the screen, either with a mouse on an emulator, or by tapping on a
phone. Since there is no collision detection yet, the character just jumps as an enemy floats by.

I did not make any of the assets for the game, and full attribution for that goes to the following creators
on [itch.io](https://itch.io):

* [Player and Enemy: LuizMelo](https://luizmelo.itch.io)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Dart and the Flutter and Flame frameworks. Flutter provided the mobile app
support, while Flame was the game framework I chose to use.
